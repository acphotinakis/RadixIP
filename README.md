# RadixIP
▪	Constructed a highly efficient radix tree-based database, utilizing bit manipulation in C for storing IPV4 addresses. Implemented an Abstract Data Type radix tree, showcasing improved time complexities and efficiency over traditional data structures.
▪	Developed a user-friendly query session enabling retrieval of information with full or partial IPV4 addresses.
▪	Utilized Vim and Bash for code editing and development workflow and employed Valgrind for memory leak detection and GDB for debugging and analyzing program behavior.
